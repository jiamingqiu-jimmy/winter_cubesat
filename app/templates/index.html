<!-- About -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="about">
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">MY PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND</h3>
        <p>I am Michael Simmons. I began my accounting career after graduation from San Francisco State University.  I passed the CPA exam on my first sitting, a feat accomplished by less than 5% of the applicants.  I then joined the "Big Eight" firm of Arthur Young, where I participated in audits of multi-national corporations, fraud and defalcation audits, as well as various consulting assignments.  At a local San Francisco accounting firm, I was active providing accounting, management and computer consulting services to manufacturers and businesses engaged in providing professional services.
        <br>
        <br>
        Throughout my career, I have honed my computer skills through hands-on experience and classroom instruction, so that I can now offer advanced computer consulting services in conjunction with or in  addition to accounting related services.  This has proven to be an advantage to businesses that are attempting to increase the reliability and usefulness of accounting data, or are contemplating a change in accounting software or hardware.  I am especially well trained in operating Quicken and QuickBooks software product  lines.
        <br>
        <br>
        Through my experiences, I have developed a sound foundation from which to provide a variety of tax, management and computer related services.  In 1988, I began practicing independently, providing services to individuals, small businesses, professional firms and non-profit organizations.
